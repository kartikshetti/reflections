1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans:     When many people are working on the same project setting up a remote allows all the collaborators 
    to work simultaneously ont he project.   



2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans:     Whenever i feel that some changes made to remote are unnecessary for my local working it is best not to 
update the local copy.So having the liberty of pulling manually allows us to update the local copy only when we want to.
