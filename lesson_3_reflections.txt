1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans:     When many people are working on the same project setting up a remote allows all the collaborators 
    to work simultaneously ont he project.   



2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans:     Whenever i feel that some changes made to remote are unnecessary for my local working it is best not to 
update the local copy.So having the liberty of pulling manually allows us to update the local copy only when we want to. 


3)Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Ans:    A fork refers to making a copy of someone else repository on github to out github account
     whereas a clone refers to copying a repository from github to our local machine 
     A branch refers to changes made locally
         I would use a fork to get a copy of someone elses repository to my own github account
         I would use clone to copy the forked repository to my local machine
         I would use branches to make changes locally
